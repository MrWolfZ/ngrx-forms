    This site contains a number of examples that showcase the capabilities of ngrx-forms. Each example includes samples of the
    code used to build the examples. Use the navigation on the left to switch between the examples.
    <br />
    <br /> I also encourage you to have a look at the
    <a href="https://github.com/MrWolfZ/ngrx-forms/tree/master/example-app">source code</a> of the application on Github.

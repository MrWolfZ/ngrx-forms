/**
 * This function creates a reducer function that first applies an action to the state
 * and afterwards applies all given update functions one after another to the resulting
 * form state. However, the update functions are only applied if the form state changed
 * as result of applying the action. If you need the update functions to be applied
 * regardless of whether the state changed (e.g. because the update function closes
 * over variables that may change independently of the form state) you can simply apply
 * the update manually (e.g. `updateFunction(formStateReducer(state, action))`).
 *
 * The following (contrived) example uses this function to create a reducer that after
 * each action validates the child control `name` to be required and sets the child
 * control `email`'s value to be `''` if the name is invalid.
 *
```typescript
interface FormValue {
  name: string;
  email: string;
